Then remember to re-run the cells after, or else they will still be using the previous value. \n","*   For more tips on getting started, please take a look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI&ab_channel=TensorFlow).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Collaboration policy form:**\n","\n","Before you start coding, make sure to fill out the [collaboration policy form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSew1CTPi2WdBOkw3kYINf3WE1iKSdUArJZmwuVFczvndkanFQ/viewform)."],"metadata":{"id":"NOeuELJqTxZC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CtgQAyEeci3U"},"source":["# Introduction"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KVB34I9mWS0n"},"source":["Welcome to your first assignment! In this assignment, you will be implementing your very first NLP model (Woohoo!) -- BOW for sentiment classification. In this assignment, you will be using a very useful NLP library (spaCy), and a popular machine learning library (scikit-learn, or sklearn) to help you with preprocessing the data and building the BOW model. In later lectures and assignments, you will learn to implement many of these NLP and ML functions yourself, but in \"the real world\" it is often more practical to use existing libraries like those provided by spaCy and sklearn than to implement these algorithms from scratch. So, in this assignment, we want you to learn how to use these libraries in a practical setting, and we'll later learn about how they work \"under the hood\".\n","\n","The main learning objectives for this assignment are:\n","\n","1. Use sklearn to implement a standard ML workflow (featurization, designing train-test splits, training a model, and evaluating the model). \n","2.
